# Project Overview
This project focuses on fine-tuning a language model to generate creative and detailed mid-journey prompts based on user requests. Using a tailored dataset that pairs user descriptions with corresponding prompts, the model learns to craft responses suitable for various creative scenarios.

# Model Details
The fine-tuning is performed on the vilsonrodrigues/falcon-7b-instruct-sharded model, utilizing Hugging Face's Transformers and PEFT libraries for efficient parameter tuning. The model leverages 4-bit quantization and auto device mapping for optimized performance.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes two primary columns:

User: Contains the user's descriptions or requests for specific types of prompts.
Prompt: Consists of detailed prompts crafted to respond specifically to the user's requests.
The dataset is used to train the model in understanding and generating detailed and contextually appropriate responses.

# Setup and Installation
Install required libraries:
'''bash

pip install torch transformers datasets bitsandbytes loralib einops
